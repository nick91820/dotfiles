# Nick's Dotfiles
<p>
These are all the dotfiles that I have downloaded and modified to my specifications. The original author of each dotfile is located in the source code of the main script .macos.

To run the setup script, please download .macos onto your machine and then from the command line go to the directory where .macos was installed and run this command:
  
  <code>zsh .macos</code>
  
This will run the setup script.

Feel free to download all the dotfiles them and modify them to your specifications.
